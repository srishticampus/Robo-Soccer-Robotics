# Robo-Soccer-Robotics

This project is a Bluetooth-controlled robot car made using an ESP32 board.
You can control the car from your mobile phone using Bluetooth — just like a remote control car.

The car can:

Move forward, backward, left, and right

Move diagonally

Stop when you press stop

It uses a motor driver (L298N) to run two motors — one for each wheel.
The ESP32 receives commands (like F, B, L, R, S) from the phone and moves the car accordingly.

You can use this car to play a Robo Soccer game, where each player controls their own car and tries to push a small ball into the goal — just like playing soccer with robots!
